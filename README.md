# VBA EXCEL PROJECT: STOCK ANALYSIS

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to help Steve, who just got his degree in Finance, and his parents
to analyze by refactoring a VBA script's code, a dataset with information from multiple corporations and decide the best ones to invest in.
In order to accomplish this goal, we created a VBA Excel sheet that runs all the aspects they need for the analysis,
such as Total Daily Volume and Return, in a matter of seconds.

## Analysis & Results

In order to analyze this dataset, we first have to take a look at the information inside it which is the 
one we are going to use for this project and which contains stocks data such as their ticker value, 
the date they all started, their opening, highest, lowest, closing, and adjustment closing price, 
as well as the total volume each one of them has.

Furthermore, we have also provided one chart for each year analyzed that shows each stock along with their final
total daily volume and returns. In addition, as we know how long it can take to analyze multiple pieces of information,
for a faster accomplish of it we have created a "Run All Analysis" button that gives you the data
of the year you want to review and the elapsed run time it takes to the sheet to analyze this data.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code in General

Some of the most important advantages of using refactoring, in general, are that this process can help us reduce
duplications or redundant codes, which make it easier for programmers to not create a whole new code but just restructure the old one
by creating a new and clearer one.

The disadvantages, on the contrary, consist of when using refactoring small errors can produce an even greater error that may end
in the creation of a new code or a code for the customer hard to read. Also, refactoring can be hard to accomplish working on a
team where not everybody has good coordination producing an unclear code. 

### How Do These Pros and Cons Apply to Refactoring the Original VBA Script?

The most beneficial part of using refactoring to the original VBA script was that we could summarize some of the code lines into 
smaller and more complex code, creating a cleaner structure of codes easy to remember and understand if we come back to this project after weeks or months.
